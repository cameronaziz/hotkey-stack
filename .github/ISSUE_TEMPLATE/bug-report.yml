        ### SSS
        The Severity and Scale Score is a metric we need to know for the issue you are reporting.

        #### Severity
        How severe is this issue? Is this going to cause a customer to drop Evidently or is some color not quite right? Determine what _impact_ this bug has created.
        | Score | Description | Example |
        | --- | --- | --- |
        | I0 | A critical bug that many users are experienced at the same time. Leadership will be **immediately involved** upon issue creation. | Global Search does not fetch results from the server |
        | I1 | A bug that many users are experiencing but can still use the application. Leadership will be **immediately notified** upon issue creation. |  |
        | I2 | A bug that is important but does not need a hotfix. | |
        | I3 | A bug that really should get fixed as soon as possible. | |
        | I4 | A bug that has very low customer impact. | The data panel's title is the wrong scale of midnight. |

        #### Scale
        Put on your engineering hat for a moment and give it a high level thought of the scale of this bug. How much _work_ is going to be needed to fix it?
        | Score | Description | Example |
        | --- | --- | --- |
        | W0 | Resolution will require major re-architecture of part of the application. Leadership will be **immediately involved** upon issue creation. | |
        | W1 | Resolution will likely require an engineer's full attention for an entire sprint to resolve. Leadership will be **immediately notified** upon issue creation. |  |
        | W2 | Resolution will likely require less than a day to resolve. | |
        | W3 | Resolution will likely require little to no lines of changes. | |
